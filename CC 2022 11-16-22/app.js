// John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

// Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

// Task
// Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

// Example:
// wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"

// wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"

function wallpaper (length, width, height) {
    if (length === 0 || width === 0) return 'zero'
  
    const roomArea = 2 * (length + width) * height
    const rollArea = 0.52 * 10
  
    const rollsRequired = Math.ceil(roomArea / rollArea * 1.15)
    return numbers[rollsRequired]
  }
